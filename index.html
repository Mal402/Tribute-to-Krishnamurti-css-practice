        Here is a synopsis of Jiddu Krishnamurti's teaching
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Truth is a pathless land: Man cannot come to it through any
          organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual,
          not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. He
          has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the
          understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and
          not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection. .
        </li>
        <li>
          On Individuality: Man has built in himself images as a fence of
          security—religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols,
          ideas, beliefs. The burden of these images dominates man’s thinking,
          his relationships, and his daily life. These images are the causes of
          our problems for they divide man from man. His perception of life is
          shaped by the concepts already established in his mind. The content of
          his consciousness is his entire existence. The individuality is the
          name, the form and superficial culture he acquires from tradition and
          environment. The uniqueness of man does not lie in the superficial but
          in complete freedom from the content of his consciousness, which is
          common to all humanity. So he is not an individual.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Freedom: Freedom is not a reaction; freedom is not choice. It is
          man’s pretence that because he has choice he is free. Freedom is pure
          observation without direction, without fear of punishment and reward.
          Freedom is without motive; freedom is not at the end of the evolution
          of man but lies in the first step of his existence. In observation one
          begins to discover the lack of freedom. Freedom is found in the
          choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          On suffering: Thought is time. Thought is born of experience and
          knowledge, which are inseparable from time and the past. Time is the
          psychological enemy of man. Our action is based on knowledge and
          therefore time, so man is always a slave to the past. Thought is ever
          limited and so we live in constant conflict and struggle. There is no
          psychological evolution. When man becomes aware of the movement of his
          own thoughts, he will see the division between the thinker and
          thought, the observer and the observed, the experiencer and the
          experience. He will discover that this division is an illusion. Then
          only is there pure observation which is insight without any shadow of
          the past or of time. This timeless insight brings about a deep,
          radical mutation in the mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Fear: Is it possible for the mind to empty iteslf totally of
          fear?... Fear of any kind breeds illusion; it makes the mind dull,
          shallow. Where there is fear there is obviously no freedom, and
          without freedom there is no love at all. We can see what fear does to
          each one of us. It makes one tell lies; it corrupts one in various
          ways; it makes the mind empty, shallow. There are dark corners in the
          mind which can never be investigated and exposed as long as one is
          afraid. Physical self-protection, the instinctive urge to keep away
          from the venomous snake, to draw back from the precipice, to avoid
          falling under the tramcar, and so on, is sane, normal, healthy. But I
          am asking about the psychological self-protectiveness which makes one
          afraid of disease, of death, of an enemy. When we seek fulfillment in
          any form, whether through painting, through music, through
          relationship, or what you will, there is always fear. So, what is
          important is to be aware of this whole process of oneself, to observe,
          to learn about it, and not ask how to get rid of fear. When you merely
          want to get rid of fear, you will find ways and means of escaping from
          it, and so there can never be freedom from fear.

          If I have personal ambition hidden in myself, it will always push me
          in a certain direction. That is why it is important to have
          self-knowledge and finish with ambition.
